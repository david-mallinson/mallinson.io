                        <p>Hi there, if you're reading this, congrats.

                            <br><br>First off, I'd like to state that this purpose should be to update people who care in an unobtrusive way about what I’m currently learning and working on, where I am, what I’m doing. Maybe I’ll link an important video or tool I’ve found recently.
                            
                            <br><br>I don’t like being public about much, so this is a great meet-in-the-middle for me. A great way to say something without being another post on your feed; without feeling like I have shot up a smoke signal to a thousand people after I press post. Also, no one can argue in the comment section, and I have no idea who or how many people are reading this. That’s a good thing.
                            
                            <br><br>So, to begin, I’d like to figure out a way to publish notes like these to my website without much effort and from my phone, without going through the process of pushing a commit to the repo for this website on github every time I write something new. 
                            I know tools like mailchimp make mass blog emails simple and easy, but I don’t really want it set up that way. I don’t want to send a notification, I would like for this to just be a way for you to check what I’m up to if you find the time and are interested. 
                            
                            <br><br>I have a lot of things I’d like to learn and work on as we all head into 2024. One of them is having a list of a few half-competent projects to show employers and interviewers. I’m 20, and I would like to feel more comfortable with my abilities around hirable skills. A website is meh, a couple of practical applications are better. I know I lack certain abilities, so I want to solicit some time every week to actually understand the basics of what I’m doing and the basics behind certain projects I make. I know I’m being vague, but maybe a calendar app, a repo for sending fetch requests, a browser based game. Projects along those lines.
                            
                            <br><br>Building this website was actually quite interesting for me. It started as a class work assignment but I thought it was fun. This was all built from scratch (not the language) using just html, css, and a few JavaScript methods like sendMail() for the contact form, which sends direct emails automatically using emailjs. No frameworks or templates were used yet. 
                            And thinking about how I want to approach animations on the website in the future, it’s tough because gifs look a little too amateur and svgs are incredibly more time consuming to implement. Sites like https://app.haikei.app/ make supplying frames for svg animations on websites more straightforward, but it’s still a pain, as I can just design a gif on canva and and change the background to #5eae84 or #ffffff to match the theme of my own website.
                            Anyway, the website thing is a pointless obsession at the moment. I’m spending way to much time on it, especially since it’s a personal page and I do not expect much traffic. I just think learning the basics is fun and it has been a better option to start from scratch versus using a paid website maker. There are also lots of learning opportunities this way that I wouldn’t have gotten anywhere else. In total, all I want from it is essentially a fancier linktree; a cool way to have all my links in one place.
                            I ended up getting a 100 on the website project for my INLS 161 class. Maybe that should be all that matters.
                            
                            <br><br>Moving away from code, the main thing I want to focus my attention on this year (besides school & work) is learning how to properly master tracks so they sound consistent on various speaker systems. Mastering has been a major challenge for me as lots of information on the internet is strangely vague and inconsistent when it comes to professionally mastering a mix. Professional mastering is gate kept in the music industry. Prove me wrong. But in total, this hesitancy on having a finished master for tracks that are already done has held me back from releasing music for a lot longer than I’m happy with. I hope I can end that streak this year and finally get the ball rolling.
                            
                            <br><br>Advertising is one of the big ones. I want to dip my toe into figuring out how to properly run an ad campaign. I feel like it’s an important skill. 
                            Mainly for my music for now. I’d like to go through the whole process of setting up a scheduled Facebook and instagram marketing campaign that I can take away some sort of learning experience from, so I can improve and do it better the next time. I know my attempts might be pretty lazy at first, with just a graphic and the song playing, but that’s all that I can manage for now with my motivation and time being split in so many different ways. I don’t have time to make a music video for an ad campaign, I also don’t care to for that matter and I don’t think it would be worth it for what I would like to achieve. My personal instagram ads are also very closely catered towards me, and I get lots of ads from indie artists in this same style: a still graphic and their respective song playing, and as far as I can tell it works for them. 
                            I think it will be interesting to see how ad conversion rates differ as I spend more or less time and effort on a campaign. I don’t care to maximize the conversion rates, I just hope they work at least a little bit. Sure, I would like to get the most out of what I spend on ads, but as of right now I could care less whether it’s 1 cent per conversion or 30 cents. I just would like to get the ball rolling and have a little bit of natural traction to things I release. 
                            
                            <br><br>As far as videos go, and I always think about this, but it usually ends up as the thing that falls on the back burner. Storytelling and making videos are probably the two thing I’m worst at now. Albeit a little cringey, and a little pathetic for how long I’ve tried.
                            I’ve put a lot of effort recently into learning more of premiere pro (key framing, after effects, animations) and figuring out a niche, style and topic for videos, but I always get distracted and seem to move on before finishing a project. I’ve gotten better, but I scrap projects before I press the publish button a lot of the time, and as far as I can tell, my youtube channel is dull, inconsistent, and not interesting. There’s not a lot of value or information being offered, and that’s the problem I need to fix. I think I will also start privatizing videos that were always really bad, as they are nice to see up there, but I don’t think they prove anything other than maybe I used to be worse at making videos. I also always get the idea that it’s not that cool of a thing to do unless there’s some type of proven success already. I don’t care a lot about that part really (statistics), but I think other people really do, and high numbers are a great way to artificially gain trust with a viewer. The more views your video has, the more people will believe whatever your talking about without any hesitation. Essentially, I call this the “Johnny Harris” effect. Haha.
                            
                            <br><br>Video is something I’ve consistently been interested in and it’s always been a goal of mine to have a distinct style and be consistent at it, there’s just a lot more I have to do, learn, and practice before I get where I want to be in that regard.
                            
                            <hr />
                            
                            Music, video, code. Crazy.
                            This year will certainly be interesting as I like to stay up to date on generative technology, and on top of that it’s also a unique election year. Two impeached elderly presidents will slug it out. One, with a couple of felonies up his sleeve and the other, which I think we can all agree, should of run as a one term president to begin with.
                            
                            <br><br>I will work towards the summer as I try to do either research, intern, or study abroad, and I’m excited to see which one it will turn out to be and where I will end up. If I study abroad, you can bet that this will turn into a travel blog. 
                            For now, I’m heading into the second semester of my sophomore year at UNC, and I’ll try to make the most of it.
